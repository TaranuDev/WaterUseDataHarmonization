# WaterUseDataHarmonization

Here I provide the codes necessary to harmonize one historical/future water use dataset for each sector.
In case you are just interested in the harmonization algorithm itself, this is the fastest way to get it and see how it works.

You can get the original/harmonized data as well as the analysis plots from the corresponding Zenodo repository (10.5281/zenodo.14850276) though it is a heavier download.
This could be useful if you would like to run the code yourself and reproduce the harmomized ensemble from the same original data I used.
At the same time, you can of course use this approach to perform the harmonization on other historical/future water use datasets.

## Disclaimer:
The code is not perfectly organized, but should be clear enough for someone who looks into it.
